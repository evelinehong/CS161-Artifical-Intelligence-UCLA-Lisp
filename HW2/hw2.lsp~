;the point of this question is that we want to take off the () from inside to ouside;
;Find the shallowest element (surrounded by least () pairs)

; These functions implement a depth-first solver for the homer-baby-dog-poison
; problem. In this implementation, a state is represented by a single list
; (homer baby dog poison), where each variable is T if the respective entity is
; on the west side of the river, and NIL if it is on the east side.
; Thus, the initial state for this problem is (NIL NIL NIL NIL) (everybody 
; is on the east side) and the goal state is (T T T T).

; The main entry point for this solver is the function DFS, which is called
; with (a) the state to search from and (b) the path to this state. It returns
; the complete path from the initial state to the goal state: this path is a
; list of intermediate problem states. The first element of the path is the
; initial state and the last element is the goal state. Each intermediate state
; is the state that results from applying the appropriate operator to the
; preceding state. If there is no solution, DFS returns NIL.
; To call DFS to solve the original problem, one would call 
; (DFS '(NIL NIL NIL NIL) NIL) 
; However, it should be possible to call DFS with a different initial
; state or with an initial path.

; First, we define the helper functions of DFS.

; FINAL-STATE takes a single argument S, the current state, and returns T if it
; is the goal state (T T T T) and NIL otherwise.
(defun FINAL-STATE (S)
     ;goal state
     (equal S '(T T T T)))

; NEXT-STATE returns the state that results from applying an operator to the
; current state. It takes three arguments: the current state (S), and which entity
; to move (A, equal to h for homer only, b for homer with baby, d for homer 
; with dog, and p for homer with poison). 
; It returns a list containing the state that results from that move.
; If applying this operator results in an invalid state (because the dog and baby,
; or poisoin and baby are left unsupervised on one side of the river), or when the
; action is impossible (homer is not on the same side as the entity) it returns NIL.
; NOTE that next-state returns a list containing the successor state (which is
; itself a list); the return should look something like ((NIL NIL T T)).
