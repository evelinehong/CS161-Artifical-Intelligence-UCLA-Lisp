The first graph (graph1.txt) is not satisfiable using 3 colors. 
It is satisfiable with 4 colors. 

So we should give at least 4 colors to this graph. 

A solution is given as follows:
Node1: Red
Node2: Green
Node3: Red
Node4: Blue
Node5: Yellow
Node6: Green
Node7: Blue

The second graph (graph2.txt) is satisfiable using 8 or more colors.
